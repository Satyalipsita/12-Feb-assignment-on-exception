    "Q-1:Exceptions:\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program \n",
    "that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, \n",
    "such as dividing by zero or trying to access a non-existent file, Python raises an exception, \n",
    "which is an object that represents the error condition. Exception handling allows you to catch \n",
    "and handle these exceptions in a structured manner, preventing the program from crashing and \n",
    "allowing you to provide appropriate error messages\n",
    "or take corrective actions\n",
    "Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program when something unexpected happens, \n",
    "such as attempting to access a non-existent file, dividing by zero, or accessing an out-of-bounds index in a list.\n",
    "Exceptions are handled using try and except blocks, allowing the program to gracefully recover from errors and continue running.\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are errors that occur during the parsing phase of the program, before it is executed.\n",
    "These errors are caused by violating the rules of the Python language's syntax, such as missing colons,\n",
    "incorrect indentation, using reserved keywords improperly, etc.\n",
    "Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all, and they need to be fixed in the source \n",
    "code before the program can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-2:If an exception is not handled, it will propagate up through \n",
    "the call stack until it either reaches an appropriate exception handler\n",
    "or causes the program to terminate. If no appropriate handler is found, t\n",
    "he default behavior is for the program to terminate and display an error \n",
    "message indicating the type of exception and the location where it occurred. \n",
    "This can lead to an abrupt and uncontrolled termination of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = divide(10, 0)  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught a ValueError\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs because we are trying to divide by zero.\n",
    "However, the `except` block is set up to catch a `ValueError` instead of a `ZeroDivisionError`. \n",
    "Since the correct exception type is not caught, \n",
    "the program will not handle the exception and will terminate with an error message similar to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this kind of situation and ensure that your program doesn't crash unexpectedly,\n",
    "it's important to handle exceptions appropriately by catching them with the correct exception types or \n",
    "allowing them to propagate up the call stack to higher-level error-handling mechanisms.\n",
    "This can involve using a broader exception type like `Exception` to catch any unexpected errors, \n",
    "logging the error information for debugging, and providing user-friendly error messages or fallback \n",
    "behaviors when needed.\n",
    "Q-3:In Python, there are several statements and constructs used for exception handling.\n",
    "Here are some of the key statements along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) **try-except:**\n",
    "   The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception. If an exception occurs, \n",
    "    it's caught in the corresponding `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 0\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Error: Division by zero!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "B)**try-except-else:**\n",
    "   The `else` block is executed if no exceptions occur in the `try` block. It's often used to put code that should run only when no exceptions are raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 2\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Error: Division by zero!\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"Division successful:\", result)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "C) **try-except-finally:**\n",
    "   The `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's typically used for cleanup operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "       content = file.read()\n",
    "   except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "       print(\"File not found!\")\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       file.close()  # Always close the file, whether an exception occurred or not\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "D)**except with multiple exceptions:**\n",
    "   You can catch multiple exceptions in a single `except` block by specifying them as a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       value = int(\"abc\")\n",
    "   except (ValueError, TypeError):\n",
    "       print(\"Error: Could not convert to an integer!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "E)**except-as:**\n",
    "   You can assign the exception instance to a variable using the `as` keyword, allowing you to access information about the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 0\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "       print(\"Caught an exception:\", e)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "F)**raising exceptions:**\n",
    "   You can manually raise exceptions using the `raise` statement. This is useful when you want to create custom exceptions or propagate exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       age = -5\n",
    "       if age < 0:\n",
    "           raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative\")\n",
    "   except ValueError as ve:\n",
    "       print(\"Caught an exception:\", ve)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "G) **assert statement:**\n",
    "   The `assert` statement raises an `AssertionError` if the given condition is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 10\n",
    "   assert x > 0, \"x should be positive\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    " Q-4:Certainly! Here are examples of using the `try`, `else`, `finally`, and `raise` statements in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "A)**try and else:**\n",
    "   The `else` block is executed if no exceptions occur in the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 2\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Error: Division by zero!\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"Division successful:\", result)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "B) **try and finally:**\n",
    "   The `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's often used for cleanup operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "       content = file.read()\n",
    "   except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "       print(\"File not found!\")\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       file.close()  # Always close the file, whether an exception occurred or not\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "C)**raise statement:**\n",
    "   The `raise` statement allows you to manually raise exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def calculate_percentage(score, total):\n",
    "       if total == 0:\n",
    "           raise ValueError(\"Total cannot be zero\")\n",
    "       return (score / total) * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       percentage = calculate_percentage(75, 0)\n",
    "   except ValueError as ve:\n",
    "       print(\"Caught an exception:\", ve)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "Q-5)Custom exception handling involves defining your own exception classes \n",
    "to handle specific error situations in your code. This allows you to provide more meaningful \n",
    "and specialized error messages, as well as create a hierarchy of exceptions that correspond \n",
    "to different error scenarios in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a custom exception, you typically define a new class that inherits from Python's \n",
    "built-in Exception class or one of its subclasses. You can add custom attributes and methods to\n",
    "your custom exception class to provide additional context and behavior.\n",
    "Custome exception handeling is needed when we want to write our \n"
